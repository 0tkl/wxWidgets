                             wxWidgets Change Log
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: This file contains the list of changes since wxWidgets 3.2, please see
      docs/changes_32.txt for the earlier changes.

INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES SINCE 3.2.x:
=================================

Changes in behaviour not resulting in compilation errors
--------------------------------------------------------

- wxDocument::OnCloseDocument() was called twice in previous versions when
  closing the document from the menu. Now it is only called once and after
  destroying all the existing document views. If you overrode this function,
  please check that you don't rely on any views existing when it's called.


Changes in behaviour which may result in build errors
-----------------------------------------------------


3.3.0: (released 2022-??-??)
----------------------------

NOTE: This file is updated only before the release, please use

    $ git log --notes=changelog --format='%N' v3.2.0..|grep .

      to see all the change log entries since the last release.

      To update the notes, fetch them first:

    $ git fetch origin refs/notes/changelog:refs/notes/changelog

      then use the following command to update them locally

    $ git notes --ref=changelog add -m 'wxPort: description.'

      and finally push it to the server.

    $ git push origin refs/notes/changelog:refs/notes/changelog

      If this fails due to a conflict because you had forgotten to
      run git-fetch first, you can always reset your local notes
      (LOSING YOUR CHANGES TO THEM, so make sure to make a copy)

    $ git fetch origin refs/notes/changelog
    $ git update-ref refs/notes/changelog FETCH_HEAD

      and then redo "git-notes add" and git-push.
